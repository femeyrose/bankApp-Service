//server point starts at index.js
//we can use any names other than index.js
but std one is index.js

we can perform the terminal operations in the terminal of VS code






http verbs/http methods

//post - to create data (like user, transactions) we use post
//get- to fetch/read any data (when browser is run, get is called)
//put- update or replace
//patch- update or replace, but partial update
//delete-to delete

REST-representational state transfer (set of constrains/rules/ it is an architecture)
REST APIs- get put post patch delete are the verbs in the restart
these are the contraints in the REST
if all the rules are obeyed by an API then it is said to be REST




//these http verbs/http methods are used in the postman

//note without using the 
// app.listen(3000, ()=>
// {console.log("server started at port 3000")});
//will not work since the port will not open

//npm i -g nodemon
//every time after any changes we have to stop and then restart (node index.js) the server
//to avoid this we install the above nodemon
//now to run the TYPE in cmd nodemon index.js
//now no need to stop and start

//3 ways our express server is created
thats why it is light weight and simple
